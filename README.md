The task was defined as follows:

Project 5 - Tutoring Services
Tutoring Services


The goal is to create an engaging and professionally styled page for a trainer that prepares students for the entry exams to certain universities in the czech republic.

The page should have:

Engaging and professional styling

Student

See all the available areas of tutoring (I.e. biology, physics, chemistry etc.) and all the details about them. 
Option to book tutoring
Information on when booking is still possible (I.e. a calendar displaying when times are I.e. already booked)
Ability to change availability on certain dates/timeblocks manually (ease of use would be important)
Filter the tutoring based on the universities/subjects
Information about the trainer 
Reviews 
Image gallery
Trainer 

Perform CRUD for a certain tutoring service
Information about the booking  
Information about the student


Niecs to haves would be (by priority):

Linking of availability calendar with project “tutoring services)
Option for multiple trainers to exist and to see which trainings they are assigned to
Connection to and import of google and facebook reviews if desired

Pretty vague and partially contradicting requirements, we have to admit. 
As there was a real client behind this project, the backlog could be refined after talking to them.
